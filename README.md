# Cavestory Remake

I'm following a tutorial to remake the game Cavestory with c++, just to learn how a game engine works and how to create a basic one using a very low-level language.

It's been really interesting and fun.

Don't know what else to put here. Hope I finish this project.

Link to the project playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ETvApbD5xRo&list=PLNOBk_id22bw6LXhrGfhVwqQIa-M2MsLa).

To build and compile this project (so far) you need the libraries [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and [SDL2_images](https://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/) which can be downloaded in their websites.

The tutorial I used to install these libraries on linux was [this one](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/linux/index.php).

I'm using linux so I already have the gcc compiler instaled. That's the one I'm using.

You might also need to install xorg-dev to run the windows and graphics (it's what made it work in here).
To install, if you're in Ubuntu or other debian dists, run these command (I think):

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install xorg
```
Then just tell the compiler or build task (if you're using vscode) to use the folder in which you'll be storing the headers with the flag -I.

And I think that's it. Any questions just ask me.
